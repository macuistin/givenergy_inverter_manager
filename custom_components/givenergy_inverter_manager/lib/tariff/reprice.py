"""reprice.py: price the half-hourly history under a tariff, and build the bill from it.

The history (slots.py) holds energy, never a price, so any tariff can be applied to any days.
Each slot's import is priced at the rate in force when the slot starts, so a rate window that
starts or ends inside a half hour is priced as if it began at the slot start. The usual windows
begin on the hour or half hour and are priced exactly.

A supplier bill takes the meter's kWh for each rate band, prices each band and rounds each line
to the cent. Pricing slot by slot and rounding once is a cent or two out for the same energy.
Rounding.PER_BAND does what the bill does. Rounding.TOTAL is the figure the cost sensors add up.
